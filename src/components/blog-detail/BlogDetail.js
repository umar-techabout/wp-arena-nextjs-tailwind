            <h3>Benefits of WordPress</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Before we get into the sites themselves, let’s talk about WordPress and its benefits. It’s clear by now that both casual and professional bloggers and site managers know about this CMS. While that may be the case, we should clarify the confusion and discuss why this CMS is so popular.</p>
        </div>
        <div className='wpa-blog-detail-item wpa-h4-font-size wpa-paragraph-text wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>
          <div className='wpa-flex wpa-gap-10 wpa-font-weight-600'>
            <Image src={ListIcon} alt='ease of use' />
            <h4>Ease of use</h4>
          </div>
          <p>The first thing worth mentioning regarding WordPress is how lightweight, accessible and easy-to-learn it is. WordPress features a very intuitive UI that doesn’t revolve around coding or programming languages. It’s visually pleasing, easy to understand and most importantly, allows for quick and painless publishing of new content.</p>
        </div>
        <div className='wpa-blog-detail-item wpa-h4-font-size wpa-paragraph-text wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>

            <Image src={ListIcon} alt='ease of use' />
            <h4>A search engine favorite</h4>
          </div>
          <p>Since a large part of the internet is powered by WordPress, search engines such as Google and Yahoo have grown fond of it. SEO optimization is very intuitive and easy to manage through WordPress, allowing for much better rankings as a result. Search engines have an easier time discerning the content of your site if WordPress is behind it due to the widespread popularity and influence it presents.</p>
        </div>
        <div className='wpa-blog-detail-item wpa-h4-font-size wpa-paragraph-text wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>

            <Image src={ListIcon} alt='ease of use' />
            <h4>Built-in blogging</h4>
          </div>
          <p>Lastly, WordPress is a CMS with ready-made blog templates and blogging elements ripe for use. You can use WordPress to host a number of different sites including e-commerce and company representative websites. Any and all of these sites can be equipped with blogs which can add further value to any visitor that may come across it. Blogging through WordPress is seamless as it doesn’t require any additional plugins to operate correctly.</p>

The site is built with Disney Company’s history and legacy front and center. It plays on nostalgia and offers a detailed look at what the company has achieved since its inception.</p>
          <p>What stands out is that the company chose a simplistic approach to web design, contrasting with their brand and identity. However, the site leans towards the corporate side by providing information on all the brands and subsidiaries under Disney’s banner. Check out The Walt Disney Company’s site for inspiration on minimalistic WordPress design solutions.</p>

This design solution is perfectly suited for anyone who operates in the design industry, be it through marketing campaigns or creative design.</p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div className='wpa-h4-font-size wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>
          <h4>Fair lvy</h4>
        </div>
        <div className='wpa-blog-detail-banner wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>
          <Image src={Fairlvy} alt='blog banner' />
        </div>
        <div className='wpa-paragraph-text wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>
          <p>You may be familiar with the numerous loot box services scattered around the web. These services offer surprise packages each month and vary based on the users’ interests. Fair Ivy settles into this niche but with a surprising catch – it’s only designed for women. The WordPress-powered Fair Ivy sports a mellow, pleasing design solution.</p>

        <div className='wpa-h4-font-size wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>
          <h4>Blue Cadet</h4>
        </div>
        <div className='wpa-blog-detail-banner wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>
          <Image src={BlueCadit} alt='blog banner' />
        </div>
        <div className='wpa-paragraph-text wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>
          <p>Negative space has often been used to showcase important information, be it in printed design or online solutions. Blue Cadet is a User Experience (UX) design agency. WordPress powers their website and features a design solution akin to the modernist art movements of the 20th century. There is a lot of white space and seemingly empty background in Blue Cadet’s website.</p>
          <p>However, this space is used to highlight the important, featured information on the landing page and subsequent links. What Blue Cadet is trying to convey is that there is no need for overly intrusive background images or textures. The pivotal elements are there, present for the viewers to see without relying on tricks that artificially fill out the screen. In this regard, Blue Cadet relies on strong copywriting, striking images (where there are any) and the user’s own intelligence in discerning what is what on the site.</p>
        </div>
        <div className='wpa-h4-font-size wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>
          <h4>Analytica Projects</h4>

          <Image src={AnalyticaProject} alt='blog banner' />
        </div>
        <div className='wpa-paragraph-text wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>
          <p>Food processing and production is a very important aspect of modern society. With so many artificial nutrients, pesticides and unwanted elements in our everyday sustenance, no wonder that sites such as Analytica Projects exist. However, the organization went a step further and opted for a very unique, single-page WordPress site solution.</p>
          <p>What separates Analytica Projects from traditional WordPress sites is its reliance on animation, continuous scrolling and creative graphics. You would be hard-pressed to figure out that Analytica is powered entirely by WordPress from the sheer number of different content types on offer. The site scrolls as the upper-right corner circle fills up with the color spectrum, allowing the user to jump back up at any moment. It is a unique solution and one that can be used in a number of NGO websites, as well as by startups across the globe.</p>

        <div className='wpa-paragraph-text wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>
          <p>Podcasts are rampant in today’s modern age of smartphones and commute. As the representative example, 99% Invisible offers a very unique take on WordPress design. The podcast’s site is built with different categories and episodes in mind.</p>
          <p>99% Invisible is a design podcast first and foremost, and as such, it does abide by its own rules and principles. It offers a very limited color palette which allows the visitor to quickly discern what is what. It features a built-in podcast player which is another WordPress addition easily added to a website. The website showcases how you don’t need overly complex landing pages or dozens of links in order to get your message across. All you really need is a stable idea and a message which you will communicate through your WordPress site.</p>

        <div className='wpa-paragraph-text wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>
          <p>Lastly, 2AM Media successfully merges animation, video, and images in their WordPress-powered website. 2AM Media is a UK-based web design agency and as such, their job is to highlight the expertise and professionalism of their designers. They have managed to do so by introducing a unique take on WordPress design, opting to build their plugins and graphics from the ground up, in-house.</p>
          <p>The result is a breathtaking visual identity of a web design agency that knows how to treat their clientele. As their portfolio extends to UX design as well as UI, 2AM media has managed to implement all of their services into their own website for demonstration. While it may be difficult to recreate what the agency managed to pull off without a seasoned web designer, the site still stands as an unusual, one-of-a-kind WordPress-powered solution.</p>
        </div>
        <div className='wpa-h4-font-size wpa-margin-top-blog-detail'>
          <h4>In Summation</h4>
          <p>Whether you are a curious onlooker or a professional designer, there is a lot to learn from WordPress and the companies that implement it correctly. These sites are only a taste of what the creative professionals have managed to pull off in their design solutions. Make sure to keep an eye out for unusual and unique takes on WordPress and try to build on those designs in your own practice should you get the chance to do so. After all, the only way to evolve what the CMS is capable of is through careful examination and experimentation.</p>
